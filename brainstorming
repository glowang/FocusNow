brainstorming

idea: to build an webapp like FocusNow to prevent usage on social media
in order to use facebook or any sites that users find useless, one have to solve a quiz question to proceed (friction)
- can pull quiz questions from classes to remind yourself how behind you are
- important goals one wants to set to stay on track
- scary staticstics 
- can vary the contents being displayed 

MongoDB: store quiz questions/quotes? 
- store statistics about the user
user_input.ejs: collect user input on what sites they would like to block
question.ejs: display the quiz question on browser
monitor.js:  backend logic: 
    /**
 *   if the http request is banned: spit out a question
 *      if the question is answered correctly, allow website browsing for 10 minutes
 *           (if the user quit the website before the 10 minutes, 
 *           they can continue using it next time without doing the quiz again)
 *      if wrong answer:
 *           give another try
 *      if wrong for three times:
 *           block the entire website use for (custom_input) hour
 */

MVP structure: 
    TODO user to submit preferences for what they wish to block 
    TODO identify banned url -> parse URL 
    TODO start recording page view time
    if banned OR used for over 20 minutes:  
    TODO pop up a form to interact the view of URL 
        ** how to store questions. Connect with a database? Pull questions online
        close the form upon satisfying conditions
        else: banned completely? 
    
        
TODO: 
    1. to parse the http request
